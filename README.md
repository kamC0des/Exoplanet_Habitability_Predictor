To quench my love of space and astronomy as well as machine learning and data analysis, I've conceived a machine learning model that analyses common features for exoplanet habibitability
and produces likely predictions for a real and researched dataset of planets. Through this project I gained deeper understanding of foward and back propagation as well as the steps and affects of Gradient Descent
on simulating learning behavior within machine learning algorithms.
